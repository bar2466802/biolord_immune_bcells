Train a bioLORD model with developing human immune across tissue (B-cells)

The data was generated by Suo et al.[1] and downloaded from Lymphoid cells.
The complete dataset contains a cross-tissue single-cell atlas of developing human immune cells across prenatal hematopoietic, lymphoid, and nonlymphoid peripheral organs. This includes over 900,000 cells from which we identified over 100 cell states.
